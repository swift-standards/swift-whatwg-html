/// `<input type="range">` elements let the user specify a numeric value which must be no less than a given value,
/// and no more than another given value. The precise value, however, is not considered important.
/// This is typically represented using a slider or dial control rather than a text entry box like the number input type.
///
/// Because this kind of widget is imprecise, it should only be used if the control's exact value isn't important.
///
/// Common use cases include:
/// - Audio controls such as volume and balance, or filter controls
/// - Color configuration controls such as color channels, transparency, brightness
/// - Game configuration controls such as difficulty, visibility distance, world size
/// - Password length for a password manager's generated passwords
