public import WHATWG_HTML_GlobalAttributes

/// Represents an HTML button element (`<button>`), which is used to create a clickable button.
///
/// The `Button` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML button elements. Buttons can be
/// configured with various attributes such as type, disabled status, and form association.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// button {
///     "Click me"
/// }
///
/// button(type: .submit, disabled: true) {
///     "Submit"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Button Types
///
/// Buttons can have different types that define their behavior:
/// - `.submit`: Submits the form data (default)
/// - `.reset`: Resets the form data to its initial values
/// - `.button`: No default behavior, typically used with JavaScript
///
/// ## Accessibility
///
/// When creating buttons, ensure you provide meaningful text content to aid users
/// with assistive technologies. For icon buttons, include descriptive text that can be read
/// by screen readers, even if you visually hide it with CSS.
///
/// Interactive elements such as buttons should have:
/// - A large enough area to be easy to activate (minimum 44×44 CSS pixels)
/// - Sufficient spacing between other interactive elements
/// - Adequate color contrast with the background
///
/// For toggle buttons, use the `aria-pressed` attribute to indicate state.
///
/// - Note: When rendered, this generates an HTML `<button>` element that is interactive and clickable.
