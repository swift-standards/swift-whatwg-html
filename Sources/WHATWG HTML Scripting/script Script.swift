/// Represents an HTML `<script>` element, which is used to embed executable code or data.
///
/// The `Script` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML script elements with various attributes.
/// This element is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code, but can also be used with other
/// languages such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.
///
/// ## Basic Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // External script
/// script.src("javascript.js")
///
/// // Inline script
/// script {
///     "alert('Hello World!');"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Using Async and Defer
///
/// - `async`: Scripts will download in parallel to parsing and execute as soon as they are available.
///   Use when scripts run independently and don't depend on other scripts.
///
/// ```swift
/// script.src("analytics.js").async(true)
/// ```
///
/// - `defer`: Scripts will load in the order they appear and execute after the page content is loaded.
///   Use when scripts depend on the DOM being in place.
///
/// ```swift
/// script.src("ui-framework.js").defer(true)
/// ```
///
/// ## Module Scripts
///
/// ```swift
/// script.src("module.js").type(.module)
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Use `async` for scripts that don't depend on other scripts or DOM elements
/// - Use `defer` for scripts that depend on the DOM being in place
/// - For critical functionality, consider placing scripts at the end of the body
/// - Use the `integrity` attribute for subresource integrity when loading external scripts
/// - Specify `type="module"` for ES modules
///
