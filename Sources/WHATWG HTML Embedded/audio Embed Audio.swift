/// Represents an HTML audio element (`<audio>`), which is used to embed sound content in documents.
///
/// The `Audio` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML audio elements that can play
/// various audio formats. It supports multiple sources, controls, autoplay, and other audio
/// playback features. The content within the audio element serves as fallback for browsers
/// that don't support HTML audio.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Basic audio with controls
/// audio(
///     src: "audio-file.mp3",
///     controls: true
/// ) {
///     "Your browser does not support the audio element."
/// }
///
/// // Audio with multiple sources for better browser compatibility
/// audio(
///     controls: true,
///     loop: true
/// ) {
///     source(src: "audio-file.mp3", type: "audio/mpeg")
///     source(src: "audio-file.ogg", type: "audio/ogg")
///     paragraph {
///         "Download "
///         anchor(href: "audio-file.mp3", download: true) { "MP3" }
///         " or "
///         anchor(href: "audio-file.ogg", download: true) { "OGG" }
///         " audio file."
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Provide multiple audio formats for better browser compatibility
/// - Include fallback content for browsers that don't support audio
/// - Use the controls attribute to allow users to control playback
/// - Avoid autoplay for better user experience
/// - Provide transcripts for accessibility
/// - Consider preload settings for performance optimization
///
/// - Note: When rendered, this generates an HTML `<audio>` element with the appropriate
///   attributes and content based on the configuration.
