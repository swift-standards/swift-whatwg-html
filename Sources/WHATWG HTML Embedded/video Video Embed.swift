/// Represents an HTML video element (`<video>`), which embeds a media player that supports video playback into a document.
///
/// The `Video` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML video elements with various attributes for controlling playback, appearance, and behavior.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// video {
///     source(src: "video.mp4", type: "video/mp4")
///     source(src: "video.webm", type: "video/webm")
///     "Your browser doesn't support HTML video."
/// }
/// ```
///
/// With additional attributes:
///
/// ```swift
/// video(
///     controls: true,
///     autoplay: true,
///     muted: true,
///     poster: "thumbnail.jpg",
///     width: 640,
///     height: 360
/// ) {
///     source(src: "video.mp4", type: "video/mp4")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Always provide multiple source formats for better browser compatibility
/// - Include fallback content for browsers that don't support video
/// - Consider providing captions and transcripts for accessibility
/// - Set width and height attributes to avoid layout shifts during loading
/// - Use the `poster` attribute to provide a preview image
/// - Consider setting `preload="metadata"` for better performance on mobile devices
/// - For autoplay videos, use the `muted` attribute to improve autoplay compatibility
///
/// ## Accessibility Considerations
///
/// - Videos should include captions for people with hearing impairments
/// - Consider providing a transcript for better accessibility
/// - Make sure video controls are accessible via keyboard
/// - Videos with important visual information should include audio descriptions
///
