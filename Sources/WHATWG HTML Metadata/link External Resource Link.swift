/// Represents an HTML link element (`<link>`), which specifies relationships between the current
/// document and external resources such as stylesheets, icons, and other linked resources.
///
/// The `Link` struct provides a type-safe way to define external resource links for an HTML document.
/// These links are commonly used for stylesheets, icons, preloading resources, and establishing
/// other relationships with external files.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Link to stylesheet
/// link(href: "styles.css", rel: "stylesheet")
///
/// // Link to favicon
/// link(href: "favicon.ico", rel: "icon")
///
/// // Preload a font
/// link(href: "font.woff2", rel: "preload", as: .font, crossorigin: .anonymous)
///
/// // Define alternative stylesheet
/// link(href: "dark.css", rel: "alternate stylesheet", title: "Dark Theme")
/// ```
///
/// ## Usage Notes
///
/// - Link elements typically appear in the `<head>` section of an HTML document
/// - The `rel` attribute is required and defines the relationship to the linked resource
/// - The `href` attribute is usually required and specifies the URL of the resource
/// - Various other attributes control caching, prioritization, and resource loading behavior
///
/// - Note: When rendered, this generates an HTML `<link>` element with the specified attributes.
///   It is a void element and does not have a closing tag.
